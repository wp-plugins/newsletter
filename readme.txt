Newsletter is a simple plugin (still in developement) to collect subscribers and send out
newsletters.

== Description ==

Deeper infos on [Newsletter official page](http://www.satollo.net/plugins/newsletter).

This plugin let you to collect subscribers on your blog with a double opt-in
subscription process. Double opt-in means the user has to confirm a subscription
following some simple instruction sent to him by email.

Each step of subscription and unsubscription processes is fully configurable (almost fully
configurable).

The plugin has a simple visual composer to create your newsletter
and send it to subscribers.

Emails are sent one-per-user, so subject and body can be customized with subscriber
name. This make the plugin NOT suitable for big subscribers list.

The subscriber management is still really stupid, but it is enough to search emails and
delete them.

The plugin is still under developement and the features below will be rolled out
a little a time:

* themes for emails
* automposer to create an email with blog contents
* subscribers importer
* subscribers exporter
* mass mail support
* PHP execution timeout bypass

Write me to info@satollo.com, please, it's the quicker way to have it fixed. You can write to the
