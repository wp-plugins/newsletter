Newsletter is a plug-in to collect subscribers and send out newsletters.

== Description ==

This plug-in lets you collect subscribers on your blog with a single or double opt-in
subscription process. Double opt-in means the user has to confirm a subscription
following simple standard instructions sent to him via email.

Each step of subscribe and unsubscribe process is fully configurable.

The plug-in has a simple visual composer to create your newsletter
and send it to subscribers. The newsletter message can be auto composed starting
with blog content and themes.

Emails are sent one-per-user, so subject and body can be customized
with subscriber name.
