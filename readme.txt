Newsletter is a simple plug-in (still in development) to collect subscribers and send out
newsletters.

== Description ==

More detailed information on is found on the newsletter's official page (http://www.satollo.net/plugins/newsletter).

This plug-in lets you collect subscribers on your blog with a double opt-in
subscription process. Double opt-in means the user has to confirm a subscription
following simple standard instructions sent to him via email.

Each step of subscribe and unsubscribe process is fully configurable (almost fully
configurable).

The plug-in has a simple visual composer to create your newsletter
and send it to subscribers.

Emails are sent one-per-user, so subject and body can be customized with subscriber name.
This make the plug-in NOT suitable for big subscribers list.

The subscriber management is still really stupid, but it is enough to search emails and delete them.

The plug-in is still under development and the features mentioned below will be rolled out a little a time:

* themes for emails
* auto-composer to create an email with blog contents
* subscribers importer
* subscribers exporter
* mass mail support
* PHP execution timeout bypass

**How can I submit a bug?**

Write me at info@satollo.com, please. It is the most expedient way to get a bug fixed. You can write on the WordPress forum also, but I read it rarely.

**Do you give support?**

Sorry, not at this time. Not even if you try to tempt me with money. I do not have enough spare time to provide answers without a lengthy delay.
