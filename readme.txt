Newsletter is a plug-in to collect subscribers and send out newsletters.

== Description ==

This plug-in lets you collect subscribers on your blog with a single or double opt-in
subscription process. Double opt-in means the user has to confirm a subscription
following simple standard instructions sent to him via email.

Each step of subscribe and unsubscribe process is fully configurable.

The plug-in has a simple visual composer to create your newsletter
and send it to subscribers. The newsletter message can be auto composed starting
with blog content and themes.

Emails are sent one-per-user, so subject and body can be customized
with subscriber name.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**How can I submit a bug?**

Write me at info@satollo.com, please. It is the most expedient way to get a bug fixed. You can write on the WordPress forum also, but I read it rarely.

**Do you give support?**

Sorry, not at this time. Not even if you try to tempt me with money. I do not have enough spare time to provide answers without a lengthy delay.
